          Gujarat is considered one of the wealthier states of India. Much
          agriculture, automobile and other industries are located in Gujarat.
          Due to the number of industries located in this state, Gujarat helped
          sufficiently in food production in the 1960s during the Green
          Revolution.

          Gujarat (/ˌɡʊdʒəˈrɑːt/, Gujarati: [ˈɡudʒəɾɑt] (About this
          soundlisten)) is a state on the western coast of India with a
          coastline of 1,600 km (990 mi) – most of which lies on the Kathiawar
          peninsula – and a population of 60.4 million. It is the fifth-largest
          Indian state by area and the ninth-largest state by population.
          Gujarat is bordered by Rajasthan to the northeast, Dadra and Nagar
          Haveli and Daman and Diu to the south, Maharashtra to the southeast,
          Madhya Pradesh to the east, and the Arabian Sea and the Pakistani
          province of Sindh to the west. Its capital city is Gandhinagar, while
          its largest city is Ahmedabad.[9] The Gujarati people of India are
          indigenous to the state, and their language Gujarati, is the state's
          official language. The economy of Gujarat is the fifth-largest in
          India, with a gross state domestic product (GSDP) of ₹15.03 trillion
          (US$210 billion) and has the country's 11th-highest GSDP per capita of
          ₹196,000 (US$2,700).[1] Gujarat ranks 21st among Indian states in
          human development index.[4] The state traditionally has low
          unemployment and is widely considered one of the most industrially
          developed states of India and a manufacturing hub.

              The state encompasses some sites of the ancient Indus Valley
              Civilisation, such as Lothal, Dholavira and Gola Dhoro. Lothal is
              believed to be one of the world's first seaports. Gujarat's
              coastal cities, chiefly Bharuch and Khambhat, served as ports and
              trading centres in the Maurya and Gupta empires, and during the
              succession of royal Saka dynasties from the Western Satraps era.
              Along with Bihar and Nagaland, Gujarat is one of the four Indian
              states to prohibit the sale of alcohol. The Gir Forest National
              Park in Gujarat is home to the only wild population of the Asiatic
              lion in the world.
