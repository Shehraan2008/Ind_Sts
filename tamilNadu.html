          Tamil Nadu covers an area of 130,058 km2 (50,216 sq mi), and is the
          tenth-largest state in India. The bordering states are Kerala to the
          west, Karnataka to the north-west and Andhra Pradesh to the north. To
          the east is the Bay of Bengal and the state encircles the union
          territory of Puducherry. The southernmost tip of the Indian Peninsula
          is Kanyakumari which is the meeting point of the Arabian Sea, the Bay
          of Bengal, and the Indian Ocean.

              The western, southern, and the northwestern parts are hilly and
              rich in vegetation. The Western Ghats and the Eastern Ghats meet
              at the Nilgiri Hills. The Western Ghats traverse the entire
              western border with Kerala, effectively blocking much of the
              rain-bearing clouds of the south-west monsoon from entering the
              state. The eastern parts are fertile coastal plains and the
              northern parts are a mix of hills and plains. The central and the
              south-central regions are arid plains and receive less rainfall
              than the other regions.

        <h2>--- Tamil Nadu ---</h2>
        <p>
          Tamil Nadu (Tamil: [ˈtamiɻ ˈnaːɽɯ] (About this soundlisten)) is one of
          the 28 states of India. Its capital and largest city is Chennai. Tamil
          Nadu lies in the southernmost part of the Indian subcontinent and is
          bordered by the union territory of Puducherry and the South Indian
          states of Kerala, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh. It is bounded by the
          Eastern Ghats on the north, by the Nilgiri Mountains, the Meghamalai
          Hills, and Kerala on the west, by the Bay of Bengal in the east, by
          the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Strait on the southeast, and by the
          Indian Ocean on the south. The state shares a maritime border with the
          nation of Sri Lanka. The region was ruled by several empires,
          including the three great empires – Chera, Chola and Pandyan empires,
          which shape the region's cuisine, culture, and architecture. After the
          fall of Kingdom of Mysore, the British Colonial rule during the modern
          period led to the emergence of Chennai, then known as Madras, as a
          metropolitan city. Modern-day Tamil Nadu was formed in 1956 after the
          reorganisation of states on linguistic lines. The state is home to a
          number of historic buildings, multi-religious pilgrimage sites, hill
          stations and three World Heritage sites.

              Tamil Nadu is the tenth largest Indian state by area and the sixth
              largest by population. The economy of Tamil Nadu is the
              second-largest state economy in India with ₹18.45 trillion (US$260
              billion) in gross domestic product with a per capita GDP of

              human development index.[5] Tamil Nadu is the most urbanised state
              in India, and one of the most industrialised states; the
              manufacturing sector accounts for more than one-third of the
              state's GDP.[11] Its official language is Tamil, which is one of
              the longest-surviving classical languages in the world.
