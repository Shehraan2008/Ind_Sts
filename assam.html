              The word “Assam” literary means “the Forest Land of Hari.” It came
              into existence on 1st November 1966. Assam is surrounded by
              Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh
              and also with River Yamuna.

        <h2>--- Assam ---</h2>
        <p>
          Assam, state of India. It is located in the northeastern part of the
          country and is bounded to the north by the kingdom of Bhutan and the
          state of Arunachal Pradesh, to the east by the states of Nagaland and
          Manipur, to the south by the states of Mizoram and Tripura, and to the
          west by Bangladesh and the states of Meghalaya and West Bengal. The
          name Assam is derived from the word asama, meaning “peerless” in the
          now extinct Ahom language. The neighbouring states of Arunachal
          Pradesh, Nagaland, Mizoram, and Meghalaya were once part of Assam. The
          capital, formerly Shillong (now the capital of Meghalaya), was shifted
          to Dispur, a suburb of Guwahati, in 1972. Area 30,285 square miles
          (78,438 square km). Pop. (2011) 31,169,272.

              Forests, formerly extending over nearly two-fifths of the state’s
              area, were reduced by the creation of Meghalaya and Mizoram in the
              early 1970s. In the early 21st century about one-third of Assam
              was covered with various types of woodlands, including tropical
              evergreen and deciduous forests, broad-leaved hill forests, pine
              forests, and swamp forests, as well as grasslands. Assam is home
              to some 75 species of trees, many of which have commercial value.
              Sal (Shorea robusta) and hollong (Dipterocarpus rhetusus) trees
              are among the most bountiful of the hardwoods. Bamboo, orchids,
              and ferns also are abundant.
